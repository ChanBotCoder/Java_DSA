# Common Runtimes

Understanding the runtime complexity of algorithms is crucial for assessing their efficiency. Here's a list of common runtimes, ordered from fastest to slowest:

1. **Θ(1): Constant Runtime**
   -  This is constant runtime. This is the runtime when a program will always do the same thing regardless of the input. For instance, a program that only prints “hello, world” runs in Θ(1) because the program will always just print “hello, world”.
   -  Example: A program that always performs the same action regardless of input, such as printing "hello, world."

2. **Θ(log N): Logarithmic Runtime**
   -  This is logarithmic runtime. You will see this runtime in search algorithms.
   -  Example: Often seen in search algorithms.

3. **Θ(N): Linear Runtime**
   -  This is linear runtime. You will often see this when you have to iterate through an entire dataset.
   -  Example: Common when iterating through an entire dataset.

4. **Θ(N*logN): Linearithmic Runtime**
   - You will see this runtime in sorting algorithms.
   - Example: Common in sorting algorithms.

6. **Θ(N^2): Quadratic Runtime**
   - This is an example of a polynomial runtime. When N is raised to the 2nd power, it’s known as a quadratic runtime. You will see this runtime when you have to search through a two-dimensional dataset (like a matrix) or nested loops.
   - Example: Typically occurs when searching through a two-dimensional dataset or using nested loops.

7. **Θ(2^N): Exponential Runtime**
   - This is exponential runtime. You will often see this runtime in recursive algorithms (Don’t worry if you don’t know what that is yet!).
   - Example: Frequently seen in recursive algorithms.

8. **Θ(N!): Factorial Runtime**
   - This is factorial runtime. You will often see this runtime when you have to generate all of the different permutations of something. For instance, a program that generates all the different ways to order the letters “abcd” would run in this runtime.
   - Example: Occurs when generating all permutations of a set, like ordering the letters "abcd."
